**A ComfyUI plugin based on the multimodal large language model Qwen2.5-Omni-7B**

🔄 ComfyUI-Qwen-Omni is the first ComfyUI plugin that supports end-to-end multimodal interaction, enabling seamless joint generation and editing of text, images, and audio. Without intermediate steps, with just one operation, the model can simultaneously understand and process multiple input modalities, generating coherent text descriptions and voice outputs, providing an unprecedentedly smooth experience for AI creation.

This plugin integrates the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B multimodal large model into ComfyUI, supporting text, image, audio, and video inputs, and capable of generating text and voice outputs, offering a more diverse interactive experience for your AI creation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multimodal input**: Supports text, images, audio, and video as inputs.
- **Text generation**: Generates coherent text descriptions based on multimodal inputs.
- **Speech synthesis**: Supports generating natural and fluent voice outputs (male or female voices available).
- **Parameterized control**: Allows adjustment of generation parameters such as temperature, maximum tokens, and sampling strategy.
- **GPU optimization**: Supports 4-bit/8-bit quantization to reduce video memory requirements.

## 🚀 Installation

1.**Clone the repository to the ComfyUI extension directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   git clone https://github.com/SXQBW/ComfyUI-Qwen-Omni.git
   cd ComfyUI-Qwen-Omni
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.**Download Model files**:

The plugin will automatically download the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B model on its first run. Alternatively, you can manually download it in advance and place it in the ComfyUI/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B/ directory.

## 📖 Usage Guide


1. Add the "Qwen Omni Combined" node in ComfyUI.
2. Configure the parameters:
   - Select the quantization method (4-bit/8-bit/no quantization).
   - Enter the text prompt.
   - Choose whether to generate voice and the voice type.
   - Adjust the generation parameters (temperature, maximum tokens, etc.).
3. Optional: Connect image, audio, or video inputs.
4. Execute the node to generate the results.

## 🎛️ Parameter Explanation

| Parameter               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_tokens`       | Controls the maximum length of the generated text (in tokens). Generally, 100 tokens correspond to approximately 50 - 100 Chinese characters or 67 - 100 English words. |
| `temperature`      | Controls the generation diversity: lower values generate more structured content, while higher values generate more random content.           |
| `top_p`            | Nucleus sampling threshold, controlling the vocabulary selection range: closer to 1 retains more candidate words, while smaller values generate more conservative content. |
| `repetition_penalty` | Controls repetitive content: >1 suppresses repetition, <1 encourages repetitive emphasis.                              |
| `quantization`     | Model quantization options: 4-bit (video memory friendly), 8-bit (balanced accuracy), or no quantization (high accuracy).    |
| `audio_output`     | Voice output options: no voice generation, female voice (Chelsie), or male voice (Ethan).               |

## 🌌 From Pixels to Python: A Designer's Odyssey

Two weeks ago, my toolkit was dominated by Adobe CC and Figma files.  
As a battle-hardened full-stack designer (PM/UX/UI triple threat) with a decade of experience, I thought my ultimate challenge was convincing clients to abandon requests for "vibrant dark mode with rainbow highlights". That is, until 3 AM on That Fateful Night™—when my 127th iteration of API documentation redesign hit a wall—the nuclear option emerged:

**"Why shouldn't designers write their own damn code?"**

Thus this project was forged from:
- 🎨 A/B testing in my veins (art school PTSD edition)
- 💻 A Frankenstein's Python rig (yes, even `pip install` was trial-by-fire)
- ⚡️ UX obsession that makes Apple designers blush (though only 30% implemented... for now)

### 🚧 Current Skill Frontier
- 🎨 Design system ninja still battling async IO demons
- 🖌️ Interactive prototype guru who sweats at recursive functions
- 📐 Architecture Picasso with <500 lines of real code

### 🌟 Why Your Star Matters
Each ⭐️ becomes:
- A lighthouse guiding designer-to-coder transitions
- A digital whip pushing through coding roadblocks
- The ultimate nod to boundary-breakers (way cooler than Dribbble likes!)

> "Every commit is my declaration of independence from the design-only world"  
> — That designer clumsily typing in VSCode

**Your star today✨**  
Not just approval, but the cosmic collision of design thinking and code logic. When aesthetic obsession meets geek spirit — this might be GitHub's most romantic chemistry experiment.
